# kubebuilder-declarative-pattern

kubebuilder-declarative-pattern provides a set of tools for building declarative cluster operators with kubebuilder. Declarative operators provide a fast path to orchestrating Kubernetes deployments to enable domain experts to focus on their component instead of re-answering questions like 'How do I get this YAML into the cluster?' or 'How do I update it?'.

## Development

### Running Smoke Tests

Smoke tests are provided to ensure basic functionality of the framework against example operators. They should be run as part of significant code changes. The tests require a running Kubernetes cluster to be targeted from the local machine and write access to a GCR bucket.

```bash
cd hack
IMG=<a writeable image path, eg, gcr.io/my-project/controller:latest> go run smoketest.go
```
